Description: "safe" C libc extensions (Annex K) - dev
 This library implements controversial C11 Annex K (TR24731) extensions. 
 They are most commonly known as _s variants implemented by MSVC, dubbed as
 "secure" to the point of MSVC-related linters claiming standard functions
 to be deprecated.  However, they've been nearly-universally panned by other
 libc implementors, the most recent discussion about Annex K removal and/or
 deprecation being N1967.  It is recommended to avoid using these functions
 -- they're either prone to misuse or merely inefficient (measuring a
 string's length multiple times being the most frequent case).
 .
 Yet despite these downsides, it is nice to have these functions available
 when porting some software that originated on Windows.
 .
 This package includes development headers.
